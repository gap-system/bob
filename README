See 
  http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/bob.html
for more information.

Since you are reading this, you have already downloaded one of the
architecture-dependent archives.

On Linux, copy the executable "bob" to an empty directory on a
filesystem with at least 1GB of free space and run the executable. The
path name to this directory must not contain spaces.

On Mac OSX click on the Applescript application "BOB.app" and choose an
empty directory on a filesystem with at least 1GB of free space. The
path name to this directory must not contain spaces.

In either case, if any important tool is missing you get an immediate
diagnosis and hints on how to fix the problems. If all necessary tools
are there, after 10-30 minutes (depending on the speed of your internet
connection, hard disk and computer), you will see a status report about
the installation process and hopefully have a fully functional GAP
4.5 in the gap4r5 directory of the current directory. Additionally,
you have a few startup scripts to start GAP in the current directory.
You can copy them to an arbitrary place in your PATH to complete the
installation.
