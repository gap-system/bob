Future:

Check failure in Browse package --> need to detect???
  --> in -m32 mode also check for 32-bit ncurses and panel
  --> need -m32-testing of libs and headers
test in chroot prison?
pargap???
exclude some components   -x
selfupdate
Implement test for C++ compiler
More tests?

Basic:

apt-get install gcc make m4 libc6-dev libreadline-dev

for packages (including xgap):

apt-get install libgsl0-dev libx11-dev libxt-dev libxaw7-dev libgmp3-dev libncurses-dev

for fr:

apt-get install free-java-sdk

for -m32 on a 64-bit machine:

apt-get install ia32-libs libc6-dev-i386 lib32ncurses5-dev lib32readline5-dev
