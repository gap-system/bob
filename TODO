make cd command which logs that it was done, maybe mkdir command?
add -I and -L to CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS on Mac for /usr/local:/opt:/opt/local
collect rpm hints
collect emerge hints
detect Linux variant by some heuristics
union of debian hints
union of rpm hints
union of emerge hints
detect Mac installer variant by some heuristics
detect 64bit and 32bit deps separately for Browse at least and act
  accordingly
find fink hints
find macports hints
find homebrew hints
union of hints for Mac
homology package?
compile linboxing
look through LoadAllPackages to find further packages to compile
implement optional components



Future:

Check failure in Browse package --> need to detect???
  --> in -m32 mode also check for 32-bit ncurses and panel
  --> need -m32-testing of libs and headers
test in chroot prison?
pargap???
exclude some components   -x
selfupdate
Implement test for C++ compiler
More tests?
optional libsingular

apt-get install gcc make m4 libc6-dev libreadline-dev

for packages (including xgap):

apt-get install libgsl0-dev libx11-dev libxt-dev libxaw7-dev libgmp3-dev libncurses-dev

for fr:

apt-get install free-java-sdk

for -m32 on a 64-bit machine:
