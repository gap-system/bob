carat needs gmp? add a check --> no, but why does it not work on Debian64?
Check failure in Browse package --> need to detect???
Check for readline-dev for Browse
Compile and finish web page



Future:

test in chroot prison?
pargap???
exclude some components   -x
selfupdate
Implement test for C++ compiler
More tests?
